<h3 id="slagTitle">SLAG</h3>
<p>The men of the Beta Beta chapter of Pi Kappa Alpha have a long history of dominance at UW because of our emphasis on building our members into the top Scholars, Leaders, Athletes and Gentlemen. Thus, SLAG.</p>
<p>SLAG stands for Scholarship, Leadership, Athletics, and Gentlemanly Qualities, and are the pillars of our success. The men we recruit are nothing but the best, and we only select those who exemplify these four characteristics. These men are:</p>
<h3>Scholars</h3>
<p>Pi Kappa Alpha realizes that students enroll in college, first and foremost, to get an education and to improve their futures. Consistent with this philosophy, UW Pikes place a high importance on scholarship and educating our members on all aspects of life. Through minimum GPA standards, mentor programs with those of the same major, educational sessions and Pike University educational seminars, members become equipped for success within the classroom and, subsequently, later in life. Pi Kappa Alpha members also enjoy substantial academic benefits provided a wide range of majors: Engineering, Biomedical Sciences, Business, Computer Science, abd Political Science just to name a few.</p>
<h3>Leaders</h3>
<p>Leadership is the key to both Pi Kappa Alpha’s success and the success of our individual members. The Fraternity provides a valuable arena for developing and honing leadership skills that will benefit the individual member throughout life. Pi Kappa Alpha provides leadership opportunities through executive positions within the chapter, as well as committee positions within in the chapter. In addition, Pi Kappa Alpha promotes leadership through campus involvement by involving its members in positions of leadership in other organizations. Our members are all active in other student organizations, often holding a chair position. The Epsilon Theta Chapter has members active in student government, as well as several honor societies. On an international level, unique opportunities are offered in leadership training through Pike University events such as seven regional Leadership Summits, the Chapter Executives Conference, the Academy and the Convention.<p>
<p>The leadership skills gained as an undergraduate are applied in the business world post graduation. Many successful Pike alumni are scouting the undergraduate ranks for the next executive of their company. Most good jobs are found through networking- not through classified adds. Pi Kappa Alpha’s size and reputation serve as a tremendous resource for recent graduates in pursuit of that perfect job. We have countless Alumni from our chapter tell us stories about how Pike either taught them how to work, or how another Pike got them the job they’re working now. Pikes from Beta Beta tend to be very successful, often owning their own business or working in upper management.<p>
<h3>Athletes</h3>
<p>Athletic competition provides valuable benefits to college students because it involves people in challenging each other to perform at their highest levels. Pike is dedicated to inspiring its members to perform at their highest levels in everything they do. Pike believes that through athletic competition our members will build teamwork skills fundamental to success in life, bolster unity within the chapter, and improve the quality of their overall college experience.</p>
<p>Whether it be through varsity athletics, intramurals, or simply sharing in the experience by supporting other members, athletics can fill in the missing pieces in classroom learning to create the overall college experience. Beta Beta, in particular, has a long history of dominating on-campus sports. We routinely win numerous intramural championships and have multiple actives participating and excelling in both D1 and Club Sports.</p>
<h3>Gentlemen</h3>
<p>Six exemplary gentlemen started Pi Kappa Alpha in 1868. Today we continue in their tradition by only recruiting the best men. Pi Kappa Alpha prides itself on the fact that we are composed solely of gentlemen. We recruit members who are respectful to themselves and others. Once they are members, these men are given the opportunity to improve and practice proper social skills and behavior through membership development programming and Fraternity social events.</p>
<p>Producing quality gentlemen is the most important aspect of our Fraternity.</p>
